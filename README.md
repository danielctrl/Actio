# Actio Project


## Objective

This project is intended to be used as a project where I can improve my skills regarding "MicroServices", "CQRS", "RabbitMQ", ".NET 5.0" and "React".

The idea is just to create a simple but functional web app where you'll be able to manage all of your physical activities in a period. It might be added new stuff, such usage of React Native and so on... nothing is clear now =)

Btw, maybe I'll change the subject later on to bring something that could be usefull for me or someone else.

## Relevant info for developing:
